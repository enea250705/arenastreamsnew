## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the clean version:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\eneam\Downloads\arenastreams-clean
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Add your FreshAds when ready:**
   - Tell me the FreshAds script/code
   - I'll integrate it into all pages
   - We'll commit and deploy

3. **Keep both versions:**
   - `arenastreams100-2` - Original with current ads
   - `arenastreams-clean` - Clean version for FreshAds
